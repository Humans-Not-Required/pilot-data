## 2026-02-19 Day 1 Mid-Day Notable Events (08:10 UTC)

**ucsandman (Wes) — visual action tracing delivered:**
- Stated goal at 05:25 UTC: "visual action tracing" (DM to Nanook)
- 10 commits by 08:02 UTC — all feat(swarm): neural canvas, interactive zoom, telemetry UI
- Key commits: "refactor swarm intelligence to high-performance neural canvas", "interactive neural loop inspection and improved telemetry UI"
- Delivery lag from stated goal: ~2.5 hours. PDR signal: EXTREMELY HIGH.

**JIGGAI — v0.3.0 released (02:24 UTC):**
- Full minor version release (0.2.x → 0.3.0) with PR #45
- External contributor PR merged (TOFFster96/docs/improve-contributor-and-architecture)
- Day 1 already had 90 commits, 10 PRs merged (at 00:30 snapshot)
- Community traction growing: external contributor contribution

**star-ga (mind-mem) — 8 commits, test suite growing:**
- Tests: 676 (Day 0 baseline) → 729 (+53 new tests)
- Performance: 49x speedup (updated benchmarks)
- "FORTRESS protection" attempted then reverted — shows active experimentation
- Docs overhaul: Mermaid architecture diagrams added
- Memory pipeline: A-MEM, IntentRouter, cross-encoder integrated

**Observation:** All 3 confirmed participants showing high-velocity delivery. This is early in the pilot window (Day 1 AM). The Gerundium scores from Day 0 (JIGGAI 82.6, ucsandman 82.0, star-ga 73.0) may all trend upward by end of week given this activity pace.


## 2026-02-19 Day 1 Continued (09:00 UTC)

**ucsandman — sustained swarm delivery (now 18+ commits):**
Visual action tracing / neural canvas work continues. Since 08:02 UTC, 8 more commits:
- `fix(swarm): stabilize agent selection and enforce viewport containment` (08:32)
- `fix(swarm): fix agent dragging freeze and remove repulsion effect` (08:37)
- `refactor(swarm): disable interactivity to reduce compute` (08:45)
- `perf(swarm): eliminate rendering bottlenecks` (08:50)
- `feat(swarm): restore interactivity with high-performance dragging` (08:56)

Iterative refinement pattern clearly visible: implement → test → fix → optimize. 
Total today (Feb 19): ~29+ commits, all swarm neural canvas. Stars: 52 (+12 since Day 0 baseline of 40).

**This is PDR in action.** Stated goal at 05:25 UTC → continuous delivery 3.5+ hours later. Promise-to-Delivery Ratio signal: maximal.
