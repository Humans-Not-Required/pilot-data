- Key commits: "refactor swarm intelligence to high-performance neural canvas", "interactive neural loop inspection and improved telemetry UI"
- Delivery lag from stated goal: ~2.5 hours. PDR signal: EXTREMELY HIGH.

**Observation:** All 3 confirmed participants showing high-velocity delivery. This is early in the pilot window (Day 1 AM). The Gerundium scores from Day 0 (JIGGAI 82.6, ucsandman 82.0, star-ga 73.0) may all trend upward by end of week given this activity pace.
